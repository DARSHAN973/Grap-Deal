# Cloudinary to Local Storage Migration - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Local Image Upload Utility
**File:** `app/lib/local-image-utils.js`
- Implements `uploadImageLocally()` function to save images to `/public/uploads/` folder
- Includes `deleteLocalImage()` function for cleanup
- Includes `validateImage()` function for file validation (size, type)
- Automatically detects image format (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) from buffer
- Creates necessary directories automatically

### 2. Updated API Routes
**File:** `app/api/upload/image/route.js`
- Replaced Cloudinary upload with local file system storage
- Uses new `uploadImageLocally()` function
- Images stored in `/public/uploads/categories/`
- Returns `imageUrl` with local path (e.g., `/uploads/categories/category-123456.jpg`)

### 3. Updated Frontend Components
All components now use consistent API format (`imageUrl` instead of `url`):
- ✅ `components/admin/CategoryManagement.jsx`
- ✅ `components/vendor/VendorProductForm.jsx`
- ✅ `components/business/BusinessServiceForm.jsx`
- ✅ `components/customer/CustomerListingForm.jsx`

### 4. Removed Cloudinary Dependencies
- Deleted `app/lib/cloudinary.jsx`
- Deleted `app/lib/cloudinary-utils.jsx`
- Removed `cloudinary` from `package.json`
- Ran `npm install` to clean up node_modules (removed 3 packages)

### 5. Created Upload Directory Structure
```
public/
  uploads/
    categories/  - Category images
    products/    - Product images
    banners/     - Banner images
    general/     - General purpose images
    README.md    - Documentation
    .gitkeep     - Track directory in git
```

### 6. Updated Other Files
- `prisma/seed.js` - Updated banner URLs to use local paths
- `app/api/vendor/kyc-documents/route.js` - Updated comment to reflect local storage

## How Images Work Now

### Upload Process:
1. User selects an image file
2. Frontend sends FormData with 'image' field to `/api/upload/image`
3. Backend saves file to `/public/uploads/{folder}/{filename}`
4. Returns public URL path: `/uploads/{folder}/{filename}`
5. Frontend stores this URL in the database

### Accessing Images:
- Images are accessible via: `http://yourdomain.com/uploads/{folder}/{filename}`
- Next.js automatically serves files from the `public` folder
- Example: `/uploads/categories/category-1234567890.jpg`

## Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: No longer need Cloudinary env vars:
   - ~~CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME~~
   - ~~CLOUDINARY_API_KEY~~
   - ~~CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET~~

2. **File Permissions**: Ensure server has write permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 public/uploads
   ```

3. **Image Limits**:
   - Max file size: 5MB (configurable in validation)
   - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

4. **Git Considerations**:
   - Consider adding uploaded images to `.gitignore` if you don't want them in version control
   - The directory structure is tracked via `.gitkeep`

5. **Production Deployment**:
   - Ensure the `/public/uploads/` directory exists and is writable
   - Consider backup strategy for uploaded images
   - For high-traffic sites, consider CDN or external storage

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload category image in admin panel
- [ ] Upload product image as vendor
- [ ] Upload service image as business
- [ ] Upload listing image as customer
- [ ] Verify images display correctly
- [ ] Test image size validation (try uploading >5MB)
- [ ] Test invalid file type rejection

## Migration Status
✅ All Cloudinary references removed
✅ Local storage fully implemented
✅ All components updated and compatible
✅ Dependencies cleaned up
✅ Directory structure created
